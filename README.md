# Google Analytics 4 for Adapt Framework

This plugin integrates [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://developers.google.com/analytics) with the [Adapt Learning](https://www.adaptlearning.org/) framework. It allows for enhanced tracking of user interactions and learning behavior using the GA4 `gtag.js` or Google Tag Manager (GTM) `dataLayer`.

> Originally based on [nachocinalli/adapt-gtag](https://github.com/nachocinalli/adapt-gtag), but modified and extended for internal use.
